# jQuery CloneYa


CloneYa is a jQuery class useful for cloning DOM elements with their children. I wanted to be able to clone form inputs and groups of form inputs or fieldsets, or even whole forms. With time, I've hopefully made it very generic.


## Usage


```javascript
	
	$clonecontainer.cloneya({
            limit		: 999,
            cloneThis		: '.toclone',
            valueClone		: false,
            dataClone		: false,
            deepClone		: false,
            cloneButton		: '.clone',
            deleteButton	: '.delete',
            clonePosition	: 'after'
        });
```


## Requirements


CloneYa must be invoked on a wrapper with the clonable items as children. It automatically recognizes this markup, by default (except the *clone-wrapper*) :


```html
	<div class="clone-wrapper">
		<div class="toclone">
		...
			<div class="clone">+</div>
			<div class="delete">-</div>
		</div>	
	</div>
```

```javascript
	$('.clone-wrapper').cloneya();
```


It need not be div's as in the above example. It might, as well have been table &gt; tr, or a ul &gt; li arrangement. 

## Options

**option** *default*


**limit** *999*

The maximum number of clones that should be generated


**cloneThis** *'.toclone'*

Any valid jQuery selector for the clonable elements


**valueClone** *false*

Copy the values of form inputs inside the clonable?


**dataClone** *false*

Copy the jQuery data with the clone element object?


**deepClone** *false*

Copy the events too, very deep copying?


**cloneButton** *'.clone'*

Any valid jQuery selector for the element that triggers cloning. Must be a child of the *cloneThis* selector


**deleteButton** *'.delete'*

Any valid jQuery selector for the element that triggers clone deletion. Must be a child of the *cloneThis* selector

**clonePosition** *'after'*

The position the clone will be inserted.

Possible values:

*'before'* before the clonable
*'after'* after the clonable
*'start'* before the first clone (to do)
*'end'* after the last clone (to do)

## Events

### Generic events

```javascript
	$clonewrapper.on( 'clone_clone', function(e){
		console.log('yay! cloned again!');
	});
```
```javascript
	$my_custom_clone_trigger = $('.clone-that');
	$my_custom_clone_trigger.on( 'mouseenter', function(e){
		$clonewrapper.trigger('clone_clone');
	});
```
**clone_clone**
The clone event, triggered when the cloneButton is clicked. Useful for custom binding


**clone_delete**
The delete event, triggered when the deleteButton is clicked. Useful for custom binding


### Specific events

*can be used as hooks*

**event** *parameter1, parameter2, &hellip;*

```javascript
	$clonewrapper.on( 'clone_after_append', function(e,newclone){
		console.log('a new clone was created:');
		console.log( newclone );
	});
```


**clone_before_clone** *$toclone*

Just before an element is cloned


**clone_form_input** *$form_input, $toclone, $newclone*
